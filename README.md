# T1S0_To_WF

This repository contains the analysis pipeline and relevant scripts used in the study: "Mapping a Reproducible Water Fraction and T1 using MP2RAGE and Variable Flip Angle Quantitative MRI Protocols*".
The pipeline estimates the water fraction (WF) maps from quantitative MRI (qMRI) data, using two acquisition protocols estimating T1 - VFA and MP2RAGE.

The repository includes:
- Scripts for T1 and S0 map estimation
- PD estimation
- WF calculation



## Dependencies:
The script uses functions and tools from the following repositories (linked in the README):
 - mrQ - https://github.com/mezera/mrQ/tree/master
 - MP2RAGE-related-scripts - https://github.com/JosePMarques/MP2RAGE-related-scripts/tree/master
 - Vistasoft - https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft
 - SPM8 - https://github.com/spm/spm8

Please ensure that these repositories are installed and added to your MATLAB path.
