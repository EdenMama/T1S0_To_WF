# T1S0_To_WF

This repository contains the analysis pipeline and relevant scripts used in the study: "Mapping a Reproducible Water Fraction and T1 using MP2RAGE and Variable Flip Angle Quantitative MRI Protocols*".
The pipeline estimates the water fraction (WF) maps from quantitative MRI (qMRI) data, using two acquisition protocols to estimate T1 relaxation time VFA and MP2RAGE.
We proposed a calibration method for deriving WF maps from proton density (PD) map.

The repository includes:
- Scripts for T1 and S0 map estimation
- PD estimation
- WF calculation
